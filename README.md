# GodotShaderUtils
Shader utils for Godot 4.0, includes noise funcions, triplanar mapping, and other useful stuff!

# Where to find the files?
The shader library files are under `materials/shaders/include`, with the `.gdshaderinc` extension.

# How do I include these in my shaders?
Given that you just copy paste the `materials` folder to your project directory:
```C
#include "res://materials/shaders/include/<FILE>.gdshaderinc"
```
